# Project 1-1

This is the (re)implementation of C++ primitives for various matrix and 
vector operations.

The code is extensively templated and is checked against a large suite
of tests.

## Use

Simply include ```mat.h``` and ```vec.h``` and you're ready to rock and roll

## Testing

To compile, use 

```bash
 make test && ./test 
```
